      <h2>Ethnographic Research/Anthropology </h2>
      <p>
        My ethnography project explores the cultural and linguistic evolution of the Telugu community in Lake County, IL. Through fieldwork, I documented generational differences and cultural practices, highlighting how Telugu-Americans maintain their heritage while adapting to American society. It discusses topics such as gender roles, Hinduism, food, gift-giving, and more. For convenience, because the ethnography is long, I have attached two versions: one with the intro and a sample chapter, and another of the whole ethnography. Please keep in mind I am still in the process of putting into words all my findings (as I continue doing ethnographic research). As a result, you may see various ethnographies depending on when you come to the website. I will try my absolute best to upload updated versions, but reach out to me under the contact section to reach me immediately. I was also able to create a podcast with my interview with a Telugu-American cook. Feel free to take a listen(google drive link).

      <h2>Project UNITY: Cardiac Health Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        As a lead intern in Project UNITYâ€™s cardiac group, I contributed to raising awareness about Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), particularly within the African American community. My research highlighted health disparities and offered actionable solutions, culminating in the award for best research paper. Below I have attached 2 versions of our research paper: a longer, more extensive version covering more literature, and a more condensed, readable version that has been published in the International Collegiate Journal of Science. Our group also created a poster project for the Public Health conference. Lastly, I was able to write a story/journal article that was published! Links to everything are below:

      <h2>Sudden Cardiac-death Awareness Research Foundation (SCARF)</h2>
      <p>
        During my internship with SCARF, I researched Sudden Cardiac Death prevention and worked on public health initiatives to spread awareness, specifically in terms of Ethnic Women. My group was able to work closely with cardiologist Dr. Paul Nguyen and various stakeholders including owners of gyms and hospitals. We developed a poster project titled Empower with C.A.R.E, and after a 6-week internship, we presented our findings to a panel of judges. Ultimately, we won the Community Outreach Award ($500+ grant) for our project!
