    <h2>Ethnography on the Telugu Community in Lake County, IL</h2>
    <p>
      My ethnography project explores the cultural and linguistic evolution of the Telugu community in Lake County, IL. Through fieldwork, I documented generational differences and cultural practices, highlighting how Telugu-Americans maintain their heritage while adapting to American society. It discusses topics such as gender roles, Hinduism, food, gift-giving, and more. For convenience, because the ethnography is long, I have attached two versions: one with the intro and a sample chapter, and another of the whole ethnography. Please keep in mind I am still in the process of putting into words all my  findings(as I continue doing ethnographic research). As a result, you may see various ethnographies depending on when you come to the website. I will try my absolute best to upload updated versions, but reach out to me under the contact section to reach me immediately.

        As a lead intern in Project UNITYâ€™s cardiac group, I contributed to raising awareness about coronary artery disease, particularly within the African American community.
