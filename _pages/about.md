    Hi all!
    
    My name is Dhruv Malladi, and I'm a prospective college student. I live in the suburbs of Illinois, in a pretty big town called Vernon Hills, about a 40-minute drive to Chicago. If you are here, I'm guessing I probably gave you the linkâ€”either way, thank you for stopping by and taking the opportunity to get to know me better.

    I go to Stevenson High School, a huge public school close to my house. Going to a large public school has taught me a lot. Obviously, there's a fair share of toxicity, but I've been able to engage in so many clubs, meet so many people, and explore subject areas I thought I would not have been able to. For example, this year, I'm taking AP African American Studies. I really wanted to take the class, and I'm glad that my school, especially out of many that ban the course, offers it. In terms of clubs, I'm heavily involved in Catalyst (substance use prevention) and Model UN. I'm also involved in the National Honor Society, Peer Tutors, and Peer Helpers.

    Outside of school, my hobbies include hiking, playing squash, skiing, reading books, and going out for Korean BBQ. I'm always eager to try new things, and love learning about stuff I haven't learned about before. I love to spend time with my family, but also with my friends.

    Squash is probably my favorite, as I've been playing it ever since I was a kid. I now coach squash alongside playing it competitively, working at Life Time Fitness. While I can't play squash competitively this year due to a lung injury (unique but life-changing story for sure), I can't wait to get back on the court.

    Academically, I have many things I'm interested in. But at the college level, I'm particularly interested in studying Anthropology, especially as it relates to culture. I've become increasingly fascinated with cultures around the world, but especially the culture I live as a Telugu American. I began to do more anthropology-oriented work over the past 2 summers, including writing an ethnography (on my research tab) and taking a class at Harvard. There, I was able to explore the intersection and dynamic between cultures and humans. There's so many more systems, elements, and notions that we fail to recognize every day, and it's only been through an anthropological lens that I've been able to see the world with such a culturally rich viewpoint.
