    Hi all!
    
    Before I start, I want to emphasize that my coding skills are far from perfect. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any concerns about my website.
    </p>

    <p>
    Anyways, hello! My name is Dhruv Malladi, and I'm a prospective college student. I live in the suburbs of Illinois, in a pretty big town called Vernon Hills, about a 40-minute drive to Chicago. If you are here, I'm guessing I probably gave you the linkâ€”either way, thank you for stopping by and taking the opportunity to get to know me better.
  </p>

    Living in the suburbs, I've always been surrounded by the beauty of flatness. I fit that typical stereotype of Midwesterners as laid-back and nice, and I go to Stevenson High School, a huge public school. Going to a large school has allowed me to engage with so many clubs and people, and explore subject areas I thought I would not have been able to. I'm heavily involved in Catalyst (substance use prevention) and Model UN. I'm also involved in the National Honor Society, Peer Tutors, and Peer Helpers.

    Outside of school, my hobbies include playing squash, board games, biking on trails, reading books, watching football, and going out for Korean BBQ. I'm always eager to try new things and love learning about stuff I haven't learned before. I love to spend time with my family and friends.

    Squash is my favorite hobby, as I've been playing it since I was a kid. I now coach squash, working at LifeTime Fitness. While I can't play squash competitively this year due to a lung injury (unique but life-changing story for sure), I can't wait to get back on the court.

    Academically, I have many things I'm interested in. But at the college level, I'm intrigued by the liberal arts. I'm particularly interested in studying anthropology, especially as it relates to culture, because I've become increasingly fascinated with the culture I live as a Telugu American. I'm also interested in computer science, coding websites such as these and taking classes at school. Unique intersections between subject areas like these are things I can't wait to explore at college.
